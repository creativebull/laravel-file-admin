# laravel-filemanager

A file upload/editor intended for use with [Laravel 5](http://www.laravel.com/ "Title") and [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/).

## Rationale

There are other packages out there that offer much the same functionality, such as [KCFinder](http://kcfinder.sunhater.com/),
but I found that integration with Laravel was a bit problematic, particularly when it comes to handling sessions
and security.

This package is written specifically for Laravel 5, and will integrate seamlessly.
